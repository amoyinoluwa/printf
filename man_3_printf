.SH NAME
_printf \- This function formats user input to stdout.

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"
int printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf() writes output to stdout under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.

.SS FORMAT SPECIFIERS
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.

.RS

.IP d,i
Decimal signed integer. The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

.IP c
Character. The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

.IP s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').

.IP o,u,x,X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters abcdef are used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X conversions.

.IP b
Decimal signed integer. The int argument is converted to binary notation.

.SS EXAMPLES

_printf("My name is %s", "Joseph");
_printf("Decimal representation of 20 is: %b\n" 20);
_printf("Octal representation of 20 is: %o\n" 20);
_printf("Hex representation of 20 is: %x\n" 20);
